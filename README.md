# BigMart Sales Prediction - README

## Context
In the current retail landscape, large shopping centers like malls and marts collect vast amounts of data related to sales, which can be used to predict future sales and manage inventory efficiently. Understanding how various attributes of products and stores influence sales is crucial for retail businesses.

The data science team at BigMart has gathered sales data for the year 2013. This data consists of 1,559 products across 10 different stores. Each product and store has certain attributes that are believed to affect sales. The goal is to analyze these attributes and build a model that can accurately predict sales for each product at a given store.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the sales of each product at a particular store. Based on the predictions, we aim to provide actionable insights to the BigMart sales team regarding the properties of products and stores that have the most significant impact on sales. This information can be used to improve inventory management and sales strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two files: a training dataset (`train.csv`) and a testing dataset (`test.csv`). The training dataset contains both input variables and the target variable (`Item_Outlet_Sales`), while the test dataset contains only the input variables. You will need to build a model using the training data to predict the `Item_Outlet_Sales` in the test dataset.

### Data Dictionary
Here are the columns present in both the training and test datasets:

- **Item_Identifier**: Unique product ID.
- **Item_Weight**: Weight of the product.
- **Item_Fat_Content**: Indicates whether the product is low fat or not (categories: Low Fat, Regular).
- **Item_Visibility**: The percentage of the total display area of all products in the store that is allocated to the specific product.
- **Item_Type**: Category/type to which the product belongs (e.g., Dairy, Meat, etc.).
- **Item_MRP**: Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product.
- **Outlet_Identifier**: Unique store ID.
- **Outlet_Establishment_Year**: The year in which the store was established.
- **Outlet_Size**: The size of the store in terms of ground area covered (categories: Small, Medium, Large).
- **Outlet_Location_Type**: The type of city in which the store is located (categories: Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).
- **Outlet_Type**: The type of store (e.g., grocery store, supermarket Type 1, supermarket Type 2).
- **Item_Outlet_Sales**: Sales of the product in the particular store (Target variable - present only in the training set).

### Training and Testing Data Overview
- **Training Data**: 8,523 rows, with both input features and the target variable (`Item_Outlet_Sales`).
- **Test Data**: 5,681 rows, with only the input features (no target variable).

### Expected Outcome
The model should predict the `Item_Outlet_Sales` for each product in the test dataset based on the features provided in both datasets.

### Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, check for inconsistencies in the data, and process categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the distribution of the data, relationships between variables, and any potential correlations between the features and the target variable.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that may help improve the model’s performance, such as calculating the store's age or categorizing products.
4. **Model Building**: Train a regression model using the training dataset to predict `Item_Outlet_Sales`. Consider using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) on the training data and cross-validation techniques.
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict sales in the test dataset and prepare the final submission.

### Key Insights to Provide
- Identify product attributes that drive higher sales.
- Understand how store attributes (e.g., store size, location type) impact sales.
- Provide recommendations to BigMart for improving inventory management and sales strategies based on the model’s insights.

### Files in the Project
- **train.csv**: The dataset containing product and store attributes along with sales information.
- **test.csv**: The dataset containing product and store attributes for which sales need to be predicted.
